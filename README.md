# CuSum
New chance for an old idea: assessing procedural performance in medical learning

The python scripts analize data in the xlxs files. 
CuSum.py analizes the tracheal intubation column from  LogbookTest.xlxs. ItÂ´s about a real case in which learning difficulties were not detected in a trainee. 
This case is used as an exemple as well in the ppt presentation

CuSum_longterm.py suggest 4 waypoints from 0-3 (i.e. beginner to advanced) with progressive, more restricted acceptable/non acceptable failure rates.

Three articles (.pdf) about CuSum grounds.
